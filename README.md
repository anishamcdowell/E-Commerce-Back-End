## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to create a backend system for a mock e-commerce site. Using Node, Express, and Sequelize I created unique models for products, categories, and tags. With associations between each of those models established, I then seeded a database w/ some examples of those models so that I had data to do a demo with. Using CRUD operations, I manipulated the database with the help of Insomnia.
